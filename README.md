Anthology is a library of SCSS mixins and functions to help you implement [atomic CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/) with ease. It builds on the ideas of CSS toolkits like [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) or [Nuclide](http://jkymarsh.com/nuclide/), where each CSS rule has one well-defined job and changes exactly one CSS property. Anthology differentiates itself by being highly-configurable and extensible. On its own, Anthology contains zero CSS. Instead of providing a set of standard rules and selectors, we provide a pattern to implement the rules you need according to your individual use-case. Think of it as a tooling workflowâ€”Anthology is the power drill and you bring the screws!
