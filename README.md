## Anthology.scss

This README is a work-in-progress.

## Getting started

Feel free to mess around with the basic example:

1. `npm install` dependencies
2. `npm run example:basic`
3. Open `http://localhost:1234` in your browser
4. Edit files in `example/basic` to see the framework in action

## Building the client-side library

If you make changes to files in `src`, remember to `npm run build` so that the repository contains the latest `dist`.
